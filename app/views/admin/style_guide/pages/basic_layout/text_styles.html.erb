  # Welcome!
  # This is a sample page to help you get started with the Style Guide.
  # To start, please copy and paste this file to something with a new name.
  # Please never edit this file (sample_page.html.erb).
  #
  # Great, so now you should be editing a file called something other than sample_page.html.erb.
  # Comments like this one will help you edit this file correctly.
  #
  # This file describes a Page.
  # A Page is comprised of Sections.
  # Sections are comprised of a Title, a Description, and Content.
  #
  # Sections, Descriptions, and Content are set up with Ruby code.
  # Ruby code is surrounded by tags like <%.
  # The only Ruby code necessary to edit is the Title of each Section.
  # There are comments below to help with that.
  # Other than that, there are HTML comments to guide where to edit.
  # HTML comments look like <!-- Put your description here -->.
  #
  # Enjoy! And ask questions if you have them.
%>


<%
  # ::BEGIN:: code for one section.
  # Please only edit where there is HTML or HTML comments.
  # HTML comments look like this: <!-- Put your description here -->.
%>
<%= begin_section_with_title('THIS TO THE SECTION TITLE') do %>
  <%= begin_section_description do %>
    <!--
      Put this Section's Description here.
      You can use any HTML to write it, but it looks nice with <p> tags.
    -->
    <p>Here is an example description.</p>
    <p>It has paragraphs! Wow, much context.</p>
    <p>For this one I'll show you the headers.</p>

      Put this Section's Content here.
      You can use any HTML to write it.
