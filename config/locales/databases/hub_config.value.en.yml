  : The deadline for applying for magnet or specialty programs is December 15th in
    most cases (for enrollment the following school year). Schools and districts will
    often host open houses and magnet school fairs in October and November.<br/><br/>Most
    magnet schools do not have entrance criteria. Check with the individual schools
    and/or districts to see if a portfolio, audition, and/or exam is required. Unless
    there are specific entrance criteria, all children who apply to a magnet school
    are accepted as long as there are seats available. If demand for seats is higher
    than the number available, school districts hold a lottery to fill the available
    seats.<br/><br/><u>Out-of-district or inter-district transfer</u><br/>Many of
    the 11 public school districts in Indianapolis accept students who reside outside
    their boundaries. If you wish to enroll your child in a school in a different
    district, you must contact that district directly.<br/><br/>Some districts will
    consider out-of-district students during the early enrollment period (October
    - December), and many only accept a limited number of transfer students, so do
    not wait if you are interested in this option. Some school districts allow out-of-district
    transfer students to apply to magnet programs, but students who are residents
    of a district have priority.<br/><br/><u>Charter schools</u><br/>Charter schools
    are public schools that operate independently. Indianapolis is home to 32 public
    charter schools, with 8 more scheduled to open in 2014. Most of these schools
    are authorized by the Mayor of Indianapolis, although a few are authorized by
    Ball State University and the Indiana Charter School Board.<br/><br/>All charter
    schools are required to follow open enrollment rules. To apply to a charter school,
    contact the school directly. All children who apply are accepted unless the demand
    for seats is higher than the number of seats available, in which case a lottery
    is held.<br/><br/><h4>Helpful resources</h4><u>Magnet school resources</u><br/><a

    may continue to accept applications after the choice application deadline.<br/><br/>Charter
    schools generally inform parents if students have been accepted around the same
    time as the School Choice acceptances are made.<br/><br/><u>Career and Vocational
    Technical Schools (VoTechs)</u><br/>Vocational technical schools are public high
    schools available to students living in each county. Most students are admitted
    for 9th grade. Each has an admission process through lottery, which means that
    the students are admitted based on random selection. Limited upper class slots
    may be available depending on career pathway and are not subject to lottery. Contact
    the appropriate school on availability.<br/><br/>To apply to a vocational technical
    school, you will need to do the following:<ul><li>Submit a School Choice application
    using the <a href=''http://www.schoolchoicede.org'' target=''_blank''>online application</a>,
    the downloadable <a href=''http://www.doe.k12.de.us/infosuites/schools/dst/DEStandardApplicationforEducationalOptionsv2.pdf''
    target=''_blank''>Common Application</a> or through the application provided by
    the school</li><li>If relevant, submit supplemental application materials to the
    school</li></ul><br/>For New Castle County VoTechs (Delcastle Technical High School,
    Hodgson VoTech High School, Howard High School of Technology or St. Georges Technical
    High School), the supplemental information includes school and career program
    preferences, copies of the applicant''s final prior year report card, most recent
    (current year) report card and attendance record. Applicants must also submit
    an essay in response to a prompt issued by the district. Students generally receive
    a letter in early March regarding admission.<br/><br/>For Kent and Sussex counties,
    the VoTechs (POLYTECH and Sussex Tech) require a completed application as well
    as first-quarter eighth-grade report card that confirms a student has a passing
    grade in all recorded core subjects (English language arts, mathematics, science,
    and social studies) and that the student has not been suspended, expelled, or
    been absent from school without a valid excuse for more than 15 school days during
    the most recent school year.<br/><br/>The application process is the same as it
    is for School Choice: applications must be submitted to the relevant school(s)
    or to the Department of Education by the second Wednesday of January (January
    14, 2015). Schools that do not utilize a lottery system may continue to accept
    applications after the choice application date.<br/><br/>Schools generally inform
    parents if students have been accepted around the same time as the School Choice
    acceptances are made.<br/><br/>Accepted applicants must provide final report cards
    verifying passing grades in all core academic subjects at the end of the current
    school year. The following applicants are exempted from the lottery process and
    granted automatic acceptance: children of current school board members and full-time
    district employees; siblings of returning district students; and siblings of those
    selected during the lottery process.<br/><br/><h4>Helpful resources</h4><a href=''https://www.doe.k12.de.us/infosuites/schools/choice.shtml''
