          students in grades 7 and 8 (it’s a standard math class in high school). When information is missing in our

          <p>Advanced Placement (AP) classes are college-level classes with a final exam that, if passed, may count
          toward college credit. The percentage of students taking AP classes may reflect whether the school culture
          is focused on college.</p>

          <p>When information is missing in our display,
          it may be because the school did not offer these courses or because the data wasn't included in the federal
          Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). Information about students taking and/or passing AP science or math exams
          is not part of the data provided by the CRDC. (See “Sources” for more information.)</p>
