          students in middle school (it's a standard math class in high school). When participation is shown as 0%, or other information is missing in our

          <div class="emphasis">What are AP classes?</div>
          <p>Advanced Placement (AP) classes are college-level classes with a final exam that, if passed, may count
          toward college credit. The percentage of students taking AP classes may reflect whether the school culture
          is focused on college.</p>
          <div class="emphasis">Why don't I see AP pass rates?</div>
          <p>When information is missing in our display,
          it may be because the school did not offer these courses or because the data wasn't included in the federal
          Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). Information about students taking and/or passing AP science or math exams
          is not part of the data provided by the CRDC. (See "Sources" for more information.)</p>
          <div class="emphasis">What courses are included in "Other AP course participation?"</div>
          <p>"Other subjects" include all AP courses other than those in mathematics and science.
          For example, AP computer science and AP world languages and cultures are included in
          "other subjects." Note&colon; a combined view of participation in any AP course can be
          found in the College Readiness module.</p>
