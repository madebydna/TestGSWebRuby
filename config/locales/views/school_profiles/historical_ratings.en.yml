        Ratings show a school’s performance relative to other schools in the state.
        Ratings can change for a variety of reasons, including changes in assessments or changes in rating methodology.
        Because the underlying data and methodology can vary over time, comparing past ratings to current ones may not
        accurately reflect changes in the school’s quality. If we are missing a rating year, it’s most likely because
        we did not receive the underlying data from the state Department of Education for that year and so did not
        compute a rating.
