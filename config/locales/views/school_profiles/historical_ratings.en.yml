      footnote_html: '<span class="emphasis">Note:</span> Ratings show a school’s performance relative to other schools in the state. Ratings can change for a variety of reasons, including changes in assessments or changes in rating methodology. Because the underlying data and methodology can vary over time, comparing past ratings to current ones may not accurately reflect changes in the school’s quality.'
