        GreatSchools is a national nonprofit organization. In most states, we publish a Summary Rating that offers a
        multidimensional view of school quality based on a range of factors, like test scores, equity, student or
        academic progress and college readiness. This state does not provide enough data to calculate a Summary Rating,
        so the rating reflected is based on each school’s Test Score Rating.
