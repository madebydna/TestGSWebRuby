          <p>GreatSchools is a national nonprofit organization. Our Summary Rating is a tool to help parents compare
          schools within a state based on standardized test scores and other data where available, like student
          academic progress and college readiness. State and national education agencies do not report some or all
          of this data for private schools like this one, so we are unable to provide a rating.</p>

          <p>GreatSchools is a national nonprofit organization. Our summary rating helps you compare schools within
          your state. Currently, our rating is based on test scores and, for some states, student academic progress
          and college readiness.</p>
          <p>Coming soon, GreatSchools will offer a new summary rating incorporating many of the measures of quality
          that you see on your school profile. Stay tuned....</p>
