         <br/><br/>In most states, we show a <a href="%{ratings_path}">Summary Rating</a> which is based on multiple measures, including
         information like college readiness, student progress, and how well a school is serving
         students from all racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. <br/><br/>%{state_name} does not have sufficient information
         for us to generate a Summary Rating, which is why we instead display the school’s Test Score Rating.
