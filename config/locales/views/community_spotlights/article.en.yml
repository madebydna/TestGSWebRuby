        article_title: Over 80% of East Palo Alto Students Aren’t On Track in English and Math
        article_intro: "In today’s economy, most good jobs require a college education. However, in East Palo Alto schools, which serve primarily low-income students, only a small number of students are currently on track to graduate ready for college. In 2014-15, only 17% of students met or exceeded standards in English and only 12% met that bar for math in Ravenswood City School District, which serves East Palo Alto students in grades K-8. This shows a significant gap when compared to Silicon Valley schools' averages: 57% for English and 51% for math."
