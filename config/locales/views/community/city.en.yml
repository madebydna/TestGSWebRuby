          MobilityScoreÂ® helps you understand how easy it is to get around. It works at any location or 
          address within the US and Canada and gives you a score ranging from 0 (no mobility choices) 
          to 100 (excellent mobility choices). MobilityScore takes into account all your options, from 
          public transit to carsharing, bikesharing, ridesharing, bikes, and even scooters!
