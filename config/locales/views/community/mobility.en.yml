        MobilityScoreÂ® helps you understand how easy it is to get around. It works at any location or 
        address within the US and Canada and gives you a score ranging from 0 (no mobility choices) 
        to 100 (excellent mobility choices). MobilityScore takes into account all your options, from 
        public transit to carsharing, bikesharing, ridesharing, bikes, and even scooters!
