        <p>All schools on GreatSchools begin with BASIC completeness,
        which includes important information like contact details and test scores.  It’s
        up to the school community to take the next steps.  As a parent or community
        member, you can share what you know with other families by writing a review
        or answering a few questions about what the school offers.  As a school
        leader, you can upload photos, describe school programs, and more with an
        Official school profile.</p><p>The completeness meter moves to INTERMEDIATE,
        then ADVANCED, and finally HONOR ROLL as you complete the following: 10
        or more reviews, at least 1 photo, and 9 program questions parents find
        helpful.</p>"
