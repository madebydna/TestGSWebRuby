      csa-title_html: College Success <br/> Awards
      csa-text: Our second-annual College Success Awards recognize and celebrate high schools that excel in preparing
        students to succeed in college. Award-winning high schools stand out based on college readiness and
        postsecondary data collected and shared by their states. These data tell us whether students enroll in college,
        are ready for college-level coursework when they get there, and persist on to their second year.
      gs-summary-rating_html: GreatSchools <br> Summary Rating
      gs-summary-rating-text: >
        Our new GreatSchools Summary Rating offers expanded information about important aspects of school
        quality — including student access to advanced courses, student progress information, and equity data
        to help parents see whether or not all students are being served similarly — that parents across the
        country can use to support their children’s education and take action to improve their local schools.
        We’re incorporating this rich data to ensure that our school ratings reflect factors that we know are
        important to parents and that research shows are connected to students’ success in college and life.

        In our two most recent reports, Searching for Opportunity and Education Equality Index, we examine
        racial gaps in access to quality schools in California and measure the performance of students from
        low-income students across the country, respectively. Our reports are based on insights allowed by
        GreatSchools’ unique data and are meant to spark conversations — from school hallways to the hallways
        of the state capitol — and to inspire further research into the programs and practices that improve
        education and equity in our schools.
