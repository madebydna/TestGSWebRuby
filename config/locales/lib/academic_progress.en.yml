        <p style='text-align:left'>How much do schools and teachers help students grow each year? </p>
        <p style='text-align:left'>Many states publish student growth data to reflect how much progress students are making year-over-year.
        This state doesn’t publish student growth data. Instead, our Academic Progress Rating estimates student
        progress by comparing year-over-year test scores by grade and subject at this school compared to all schools
        in the state that started with similar proficiency levels.</p>
