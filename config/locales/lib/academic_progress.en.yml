        <p>The Academic Progress Rating helps measure how much students learn in a year, compared to their peers across the state.</p>
        <p>Student growth is one of the best ways to assess how teachers and schools help students learn. Many states' Department
        of Education provide student growth data and for those states, we use this data to calculate a Student Progress Rating.</p>
        <p>This state does not publish student growth data, so we use other available data to estimate student learning over
        time. Specifically, for states missing growth data, we calculate our Academic Progress Rating by comparing year-over-year
        test scores by grade and subject at this school to all schools in the state.</p>

        <h3 class="negative">Very concerning:</h3>
        <p>Students at this school are making <span class="emphasis">far less</span> academic progress given where their class was last year, compared
        to students at other schools in the state.</p>
        <p>Depending on the school’s test scores, academic progress means different things.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">Very low progress with low test scores</span> means that students are starting at a low
        point and as a class, are falling even farther behind their peers in classes in other schools.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">Very low progress with high test scores</span> means students have strong academic skills
        but that students, as a class, are below grade-to-grade gains in other classes in the state.</p>
        <p class="parent-tip"><img src='/assets/school_profiles/owl.png' /><span class="speech-bubble left">Parent tip:</span></p>
        <p class="footnote">Ask the school how it interprets this rating and how it might use this information to improve its programs.</p>

        <h3 class="neutral">Worth a deeper look:</h3>
        <p>Students at this school are making <span class="emphasis">average</span> academic progress given where their class
        was last year, compared to students at other schools in the state.</p>
        <p>Average academic progress means different things. In some states, the <span class="emphasis">average progress is
        so low,</span> a majority of students are not ready for college and career.  It also depends on the school’s actual test scores.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">Average progress with low test scores</span> means that students are starting at a low
        point but as a class, are keeping up with peers in classes in other schools.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">Average progress with high test scores</span> means students have strong academic skills
        and that students, as a class, are similar to grade-to-grade gains in other classes in the state. </p>

        <p>Strong academic progress means different things. In some states, the <span class="emphasis">average progress is
        so low,</span> that even strong progress may not prepare a majority of students for college and career.  It also depends
        on the school’s test scores.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis">Strong progress with low test scores</span> means that students are starting at a low point
