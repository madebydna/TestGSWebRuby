        <p>The Academic Progress Rating helps measure how much students learn in a year, compared to their peers across the state.</p>
        <p>Student growth is one of the best ways to assess how teachers and schools help students learn. Many states' Department
        of Education provide student growth data and for those states, we use this data to calculate a Student Progress Rating.</p>
        <p>This state does not publish student growth data, so we use other available data to estimate student learning over
        time. Specifically, for states missing growth data, we calculate our Academic Progress Rating by comparing year-over-year
        test scores by grade and subject at this school to all schools in the state.</p>
