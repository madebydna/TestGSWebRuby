          <p><span class="emphasis">Why are some subjects missing a rating?</span> We offer advanced coursework information in seven subject areas, but only four of these (English, STEM, Social sciences and Foreign language) are offered in enough schools across the state to assign a rating that can be summarized in our overall Advanced Courses Rating. (Click on the "?" symbols next to "Advanced courses" and "Rating" labels for more information).</p>
          <p>Ratings are based on a 1 (low) -10 (high) scale. If a school does not offer any advanced courses in one of the four subject areas with ratings that subject will receive a "1" rating.</p>
          <p>Did you find the information about advanced courses useful? What can we do better?

          <p>The number of advanced courses taken per student at this school is <span class="emphasis">far lower</span> than state average.</p>
          <p>College admissions officers look at both a student's grades and the level of coursework taken. Taking advanced courses helps demonstrate that students are willing to challenge themselves. Plus, some advanced courses, like AP, may qualify for college credit and raise the student’s GPA.</p>
