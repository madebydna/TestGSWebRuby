            <p><span class="emphasis">Missing a race or ethnicity?</span> When the population of a subgroup is too small to provide reliable data, it does not show up in the display. This may cause certain races/ethnicities to not be included in some charts within this section.</p>
            <p><span class="emphasis">How do we come up with the race/ethnicity labels?</span> We display the language used by the State Department of Education to describe student race/ethnicity information.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The “All students” number displayed represents the number of students at the school who participated in testing.</li>
            <li>The “% of students” information reflects the portion of the overall student population at the school that each subgroup represents. For more about student demographics at this school, visit the “Students” section below.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="emphasis">How do we decide which subjects to display?</span> Test subjects shown represent those taken by the largest number of students at this school.</p>
