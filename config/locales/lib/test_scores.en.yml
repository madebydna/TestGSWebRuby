          <p>The test scores and state averages we display come from the State Department of Education (DOE).
          When information is missing in our display, it is because the information was not included in the data we
          received from the DOE.</p>
          <p>Why are grade-level scores sometimes different from the overall score for a subject? Most likely this is
          due to suppression. States are required to suppress grade/subject data if the number of test-taking students
          is too small. This can mean that some grade-level scores that are part of the overall score cannot be
          displayed individually.</p>
