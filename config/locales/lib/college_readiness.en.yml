          <p>Students at this school are making <span class="emphasis">far less</span>
          academic progress given where they were last year, compared to other students in the state.</p>
          <p>Depending on the school's test scores, student progress (also known as student growth) means different things.</p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Very low progress with low test scores</span> means... that students are starting
          at a low point and falling even farther behind their peers.</p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Very low progress with high test scores</span> means... students have strong
          academic skills but that the school is not contributing to student learning as much as other schools in the state.</p>
