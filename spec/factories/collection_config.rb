Many Detroiters offered thoughtful recommendations about the need to prepare all students for college, careers, and life in the 21st century.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2014 and the activities Excellent Schools Detroit engages in focus on four main activities across an early childhood through college continuum: 1) encouraging parents to make high quality educational choices, 2) incentivizing good schools to become excellent (as according to the 90/90/90 standard), 3) moving schools from weak or failing to good, and 4) seeing more weak or failing schools who don’t wish to succeed, close.<br/><br/><strong>Actionable Information</strong><br/>Each year Excellent Schools Detroit works with students, caregivers, school leaders and community members to produce a K-12 and Early Learning Scorecard that measures school quality. The Scorecard now includes grades to help parents and students make sense of Detroit’s more than 220 schools and find the best fit.<br/><br/>Excellent Schools Detroit recommends parents and students select schools graded C+ or better because these schools will generally prepare students for success in college, career and community.<br/><br/><strong>Voice</strong><br/>Excellent Schools Detroit is dedicated to championing for a quality education for every child in Detroit. In 2013, to ensure that parents, caregivers and community members have information that helps them find the best quality educational options in the city, ESD partnered with GreatSchools to develop GreatSchoolsDetroit.org. Information from ESD’s annual school scorecard will be used to supplement information collected by GreatSchools. As a strong advocate for encouraging parents and community members to have a voice and say in what’s important to them related to education, the staff of ESD liked the fact that anyone can review a school as they wish. It’s the shared goal of ESD and GreatSchools to create an information portal guided by needs and developments of students and families that will always reflect the ever changing educational landscape in Detroit.',               links : [ {url:'http://www.excellentschoolsdetroit.org/en', heading :'Find out more about Excellent Schools Detroit',newwindow:'true' }, {url:'http://scorecard.excellentschoolsdetroit.org/', heading :'ESD Scorecard',newwindow:'true' }, {url:'http://issuu.com/esdetroit/docs/esdplan?e=0/1954712', heading :'Find out more about ESDs education Plan',newwindow:'true' }]                }                          ] }"

Most districts have an intra-district open-enrollment policy that will allow you to move your child to that school as long as space permits. Call your school district to see what is required because each district works a little differently.

Magnet schools may have selective admission. Students might be required to apply based on different factors, such as a student’s grades or their artistic audition. Check with the magnet school you are interested in to find out what that school requires. If the Magnet school uses a lottery for admissions, admission is determined through a random number lottery system. Parents are required to fill out an application before the deadline, and then it is entered into the lottery pool. On a scheduled date, names are drawn for the school’s open slots from the pool. Check with your district to find out what the deadlines are for the lottery process at the magnet school you are interested in. Deadlines are usually in fall or winter for the following year.'},

That means that a child that lives in another district is free to attend, as long as there is space for that student in the school.<br/><br/>There are two different types of inter-district open enrollment. The first is that the district is open to students in the surrounding (“adjacent”) districts only. That means that your child\'s assigned district has to border the district you want her to attend. The other option is that the district is open to students from all districts, and that means a child from anywhere in the state could enroll in that school, as long as space permits.<br/><br/>To find out more about open enrollment and each district\'s policies, visit the <a href="http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/School-Choice/Open-Enrollment">Ohio Department of Education website</a><br/><br/><u>Out-of-boundary tuition</u><br/>If open enrollment is not available at the district you want to send your child to, you can always check with the school and see how much their out-of-district tuition costs or click here for a list of tuition rates on the Ohio Department of Education\'s site.
